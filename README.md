# Med Classify

Med Classify is a gamified mobile learning application designed to support the classification of pharmaceutical drugs through interactive quizzes.

## Project Overview
This application was developed as an Applied Research Project for the MSc in Information Systems with Computing. The primary objective of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified learning compared to non-gamified approaches in improving learners’ understanding of drug classification.

## Features
- Quiz-based learning for drug classification
- Gamified and non-gamified modes for comparative evaluation
- Score tracking and results summary
- Mobile-first design using React Native

## Technology Stack
- Expo (React Native)
- JavaScript
- GitHub

## Research Context
Med Classify serves as the core artefact for an applied research study. User performance data and interaction outcomes are analysed using quantitative metrics, supported by qualitative feedback, to assess learning effectiveness.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the application
```bash
npx expo start
```

The application can be launched in a web browser, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or on a physical device using Expo Go.
